    Args:
        number (int): The integer to process.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing the original number, potentially followed by
            a space and "fizz", "buzz", or "fizzbuzz".
            - "{number} fizzbuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5.

        TypeError: If the input `number` is not an integer or a type compatible
            with the modulo operator (%). Although not explicitly checked,
            passing non-numeric types will likely result in a TypeError
